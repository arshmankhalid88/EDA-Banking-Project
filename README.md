# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Banking Using Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to master exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the banking sector using the Pandas framework. We will analyze a banking dataset to uncover insights that can inform marketing strategies and improve client engagement.

## Project Goals
1. Explore a banking dataset using the Pandas framework.
2. Build pivot tables to summarize data.
3. Visualize the dataset using various plot types to identify trends and patterns.
4. Analyze client demographics and engagement levels.

## Outline
1. **Materials and Methods**
2. **General Part**
   - i) Libraries Import
   - ii) Dataset Exploration
   - iii) Pivot Tables
   - iv) Data Visualization
3. **Tasks and Analysis Questions**

## Materials and Methods
The dataset used in this project is a subset of the open-source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html).

This dataset is publicly available for research purposes. The primary focus of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of direct calls from the bank in attracting clients to term deposits.

### Key Analysis Questions
- What percentage of clients were attracted in our source data?
- What are the mean values of numerical features among attracted clients?
- What is the average call duration for attracted clients?
- What is the average age among attracted and unmarried clients?
- How do average age and call duration vary across different types of client employment?

Additionally, we will conduct a visual analysis to enhance the planning of marketing banking campaigns effectively.

## Libraries Used
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
3. **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.

## Conclusion
This project will provide valuable insights into client behavior and demographics, enabling more effective marketing strategies and improved client engagement in the banking sector.
